        <h1>HELLO EVERYONE</h1>
        <p>My name is Chelsea, I go by many nickname maybe because I am multi talented, in music I loved to be called OSQUARE, others know me to be Vokex, I am from Delta, and I want you to know these little things about me.</p>
        <p>In clarity, I love computers and everything about computer. These motives has been my dream ever since I was a child, wanting to do big things with computers, solving problems, and more.</p>
        <p>This is a great opportunity for me to step into the shoes as I have always wanted to and I believe this will be my stepping stone not my destination.</p>
        <p>Aside from computer I spend little of my time trying to gain knowledge about life in general by listening to music and doing whatever that can add value to my life.</p>

        <h2>Things I Like Doing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Most times I like listening to music when I am less busy</li>
            <li>Whenever I dont understand something, I go to th internet to browse it through, I guess you can call it reading.</li>
        </ul>
